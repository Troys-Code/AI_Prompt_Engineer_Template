#### Introduction
Hiring is hard, but hiring prompt engineers for generative AI art doesn't have to be. This Google Colab template is designed to streamline the process, providing a practical, hands-on way for candidates to demonstrate their skills in prompt engineering using a distilled Stable Diffusion model. Rather than just submitting a PDF of generated images, this template allows candidates to showcase their proficiency in AI image generation, including their ability to craft effective prompts and utilize advanced techniques.

#### Purpose
The primary purpose of this template is to evaluate candidates' technical abilities in AI art generation, problem-solving skills, and innovative thinking. It's crafted to replicate real-world scenarios they would encounter in the role of a prompt engineer, emphasizing both creativity and technical expertise.

#### Setup Instructions
1. **Accessing the Template**: Open the Google Colab link provided. Ensure you have a Google account to use Colab services.
2. **Installing Dependencies**: Run the initial cells to install necessary libraries and dependencies for the Stable Diffusion model.
3. **Loading the Model**: Instructions are provided to load the distilled version of the Stable Diffusion model. 

#### Usage Guidelines
1. **Crafting Prompts**: Enter your prompts in the designated input cells. Remember the token limit (77 tokens) and try to be concise yet descriptive.
2. **Adjusting Parameters**: Familiarize yourself with adjustable parameters like weighting components and step count, which are crucial for fine-tuning the output.
3. **Generating Images**: Execute the model with your prompts and observe the results. 
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Based on initial outputs, refine your prompts and parameters as needed to achieve the desired results.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- **Creativity in Prompt Engineering**: Ability to generate compelling and relevant prompts within token constraints.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Understanding and application of advanced techniques like weighted prompts and manual seeding.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Adaptation and overcoming limitations of the distilled model.
- **Resource Management**: Effective use of Google Colab, managing GPU usage and memory.

#### Examples and Tips
